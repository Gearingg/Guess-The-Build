# Guess-The-Build-Helper-Bot
The Guess the Build Helper Bot is a program that assists users in guessing builds on Hypixel based on their input from a list of words. This program is designed to make the process of guessing the Build more efficient and accurate.

How to use:

Start the program by running the Guesser.exe file.
You will be prompted to enter a list of Letters. Enter your list of letters
Once you have entered your list of Letters, you will be prompted to enter the length of the word you are trying to guess.
Enter the length of the word you are trying to guess.
You will then be prompted to enter any other known letters in the word you are trying to guess( ofcourse its optional ).
The program will generate a list of possible words based on your input and display it to you.


Features:


Auto Text Typer:
The program detects if there are fewer than two sorted words and will automatically switch to your Minecraft window, typing the words in the chat without any further input needed from the user.
Input validation:
The program ensures that the input entered by the user is valid and meets the program's requirements.
Word filtering:
The program filters out any words that do not match the length or known letters entered by the user.
Multiple guess support:
The program can be run multiple times with different input, allowing users to refine their guesses.


Limitations:


The program relies on the accuracy and completeness of the user's input. If the user enters incorrect or incomplete information, the program may provide inaccurate results.


The program is limited to the list of words entered by the user. If the correct word is not in the list, the program will not be able to guess it.
